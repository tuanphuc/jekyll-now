title: Machine Learning roadmap for engineer
---

Machine learning (ML) is a very interesting field to study. There is a fast growing need of engineers who had a computer science degree and want to step in this field and I am an example. However, it is not easy to have a clear study plan so that you can actually understand the background of ML and then eventually become a ML engineer. Although there are a lot of instructions, suggestions and even detailed roadmaps out there but I can't even know where to start because of the redundance of information in those approches. One of the most popular machine learning roadmap is one on github:

https://github.com/tuanphuc/machine-learning-for-software-engineers

which proposes a lot of studying resources which are highly recommended by many people in the field. But I found hard to start when I look at a long list of resources which lacks of subtantial details needed to be in a true roadmap.

After quite a time playing with ML both theretically and practically, I think that I can share a roadmap that is more appropriate to an engineer to have a general understanding in ML and can do interesting things with it. This roadmap is both theoritical and practical because I beleive that with good understanding in theory, you will achieve higher results in practicing ML.

First, you need to have a basic theory backgound of statistical learning (foundation of ML). Two books that are highly recommended is:

  - An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R of Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani
  -  The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction of Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman
  
Those books are 2 textbook used in the course [CS 189/289A Introduction to Machine Learning](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189s16/). You can follow the schedule of lectures to have a plan of reading those two books. There are also homeworks and lecture videos on youtube that are very useful.
