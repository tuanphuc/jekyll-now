title: Machine Learning roadmap for engineer
---

Before going in to details of a Machine Learning (ML) roadmap, I want to clarify that I am an embedded engineer who are amazed by the beauty of ML and have started learning it for just over a year. So everything I write in this blog is subjective to my point of view. 

ML is a very interesting field to study. There is a fast growing need of engineers who had a computer science degree and want to step in this field and I am an example. However, it is not easy to have a clear study plan so that you can actually understand the background of ML and then eventually become a ML engineer.

Although there are a lot of instructions, suggestions and even detailed roadmaps out there but I can't even know where to start because of the redundance of information in those approches. One of the most popular machine learning roadmap is one on github:

[https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers](https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers)

which proposes a lot of studying resources which are highly recommended by many people in the field. But I found hard to start when I look at a long list of resources which lacks of subtantial details in plan needed to be in a true roadmap. In this blog I will share with you a roadmap that I think concrete roadmap to learn ML based on my own experiences so it's up to you to decide to follow.

In my opinion, if you understanding theoritically a problem, you can learn much faster afterward. So first, you need to build your basic theory backgound of statistical learning (foundation of ML). Two books that are highly recommended is:

  - An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R of Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani
  -  The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction of Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman
  
Those books are 2 textbook used in the course [CS 189/289A Introduction to Machine Learning](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189s16/). They are available to download and you can follow the schedule of lectures to have a plan of reading those two books. There are also homeworks and lecture videos on youtube that are very useful. The first book introduces basic definition and popular methods, algorithms in Statistical Learning that are very accessible to beginers who are not specilised in statistic. The latter book covers all those things but in a higher level with detailed explanations and formulas that give you a great insight into what is behind all the different methods.

The next step is to implement some or all of the algorithms in the books to fully understand how they work. You can also learn a lot of programming techniques required to implement efficiently those algorithms because the scale of ML.

To be continued...
